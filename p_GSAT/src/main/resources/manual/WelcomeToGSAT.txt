| (1) How to set up and to start a new analysis
| -------------------------------------------------

To start a new analysis, you first have to choose a folder of AB1 files or a single AB1 file. For doing this, enter a path into the Source input field or click on the Button 
next to the field. You will be asked whether you want to specify a path or a single file. Choose as preferred and select the folder or the file in the menu which will be presented 
to you then. To tell GSAT where to place the results of your analysis, analogously enter a Destination path in the input field below the Source field. You can also choose a
folder by clicking on the button next to the field. 
Next, you have to choose a gene to compare the files with. Choose one from the gene dropdown menu. 
Make sure the output is as desired: One single file or multiple files, one for each input. You can specify this with the checkbox 'Multiple outfut files'.
Almost done. All you have to do now is click on the Start button. 
And there you go. When the analysis finished, you can find the results in the folder you specified with Destination. The progress bar will tell you how far the analysis process hase come.

>>> SETTINGS
You can adjust the program's settings by clicking on this button. The settings window is explained in section (3).

>>> HELP
This button allows you to get some help on the program's functionality (you already seem to use this).

>>> ABOUT
Read about the authors and the making of GSAT!

>>> SOURCE
This specifies the folder of AB1 files or the single AB1 file which you want to analyze. Enter folder or file path manually or simply choose it by clicking on the button
situated on the right of the input field.

>>> DESTINATION
This specifies the folder where the results should be written to. You can enter the folder manually or choose it by clicking the button on the right hand side of the input field.

>>> FILE NAME
You can specify the name of the out file(s). By leaving this field blank, "gsat_results" will be used as a default name.
 
>>> GENE
Use this dropdown menu to choose which gene to compare the sequences with.

>>> MULTIPLE OUTPUT FILES
This checkbox indicates whether multiple output files are produced, one for each input file (checked) or one single file, containing the information of all input files (unchecked).

>>> FIND RIGHT GENE
Instead of specifying a certain gene, you can also ask the programm to select the gene that fits best to the given sequences. Activate this functionality via this checkbox.

>>> START
After choosing a path for input and output and after selecting a gene, you can click on Start to run the analysis.

| (3) The settings window in further detail
| -------------------------------------------

>>> RESEARCHER
Choose your name in the dropdown menu to make sure your analyses are associated with it. If your name is not entered yet, do so by making use of the add button. 
Remove names from the list with delete.

>>> AVAILABLE GENES
The big box contains all currently available genes for an analysis. You can add or delete genes with the buttons add and delete. Only the genes you specify here
are presented to you in the main window's gene dropdown.
When adding a gene you are asked to enter its name, the organism it corresponds to, its nucleotide sequence (with A, T, C and G letters). You may enter a comment if desired.

>>> EDIT PARAMETERS
You can adjust parameters used in the analysis pipeline by clicking this button.
Minimal Start Quality: The minimal PHRED score a nucleotide is allowed to have to not get trimmed away at the BEGINNING of the sequence.
Minimal End Quality: The minimal PHRED score a nucleotide is allowed to have to not get trimmed away at the END of the sequence.
Bad Quality Margin: The maximum number of nucleotides in a row with bad quality (less than "Minimal End Quality") that are allowed before the sequence gets cut off AT THE END.
Good Quality Margin: The minimum number of nucleotides with good quality (better than "Minimal End Quality") that must appear in a row to not get cut away AT THE BEGINNING of a sequence.
Search Radius: The number of nucleotides with bad quality (less than "Minimal End Quality") that must appear in a row to cut off the sequence AT THE END.

>>> CONFIGURE DATABASE
The database used to store the results can be configured with this button. NOTE: This functionality is not implemented yet,
but coming soon! Stay tuned!

>>> OK
Leave the settings window and return to the main window. You changes will be saved.

| (4) The analysis results
| -------------------------

The analysis results are CSV files. Each line corresponds to one AB1 file / nucleotide sequence.
The meanings of the fields are explained here. 
It is also mentioned which of the to (not!) change when working with the result file in case an upload is desired:

>>> FILE NAME:					
The name of the AB1 file under analysis. 
Please DO NOT CHANGE this entry.

>>> GENE:						
The name of the gene that was associated with the analysis of this sequence.
Please DO NOT CHANGE this entry. 
Also, please make sure the gene that was used for this analysis STILL EXISTS in the local gene list (in the settings) when uploading this result!

>>> GENE ORGANISM:				
The above gene's organism. The entry is 'null' if no organism was specified.
Please DO NOT CHANGE this entry. Make sure this gene (with this organism, if not 'null') still exists in the local gene list (as above) when uploading this result.

>>> MUTATIONS (WITH CODONS):	
A list of found mutations (insertions, deletions, substitutions and silent mutations) with the nucleotide codons of the mutated amino acid. 
This field may contain the information whether a reading frame error was detected.
The mutations have the following meanings:
- insertion: e.g. "+1L24 (ATT)", the amino acid L has been inserted at position 24 (it has the nucleotide sequence ATT).
- deletion: e.g. "-1L220 (ATT)", the original amino acid L at position 220 was deleted and does not exist there anymore (it had the nucleotide sequence ATT).
- substitution: e.g. "D6H (CAT)", the amino acid D at position 6 is replaced by H (which has the nucleotide sequence CAT).
- silent mutation: e.g. "TAA6TTA", the nucleotide tripel TAA at aminoacid position 6 got replaced by TTA, they both share the same amino acid name.
- reading frame error: A reading frame error occurred, making the finding of mutations impossible.
Please DO NOT CHANGE this entry.

>>> HIS TAG:					
The nucleotide index (starting with 1) where a HIS tag was found, "none" otherwise.
Please DO NOT CHANGE this entry.

>>> MANUALLY CHECKED:			
The indication whether this result was manually checked by a user.
Default case is 'false'. If you checked this result manually and think it is okay, then change this field's entry to 'true' or 'yes'.

>>> COMMENTS:				
Comments entered by the user.
Feel free to edit the comment field as required. (see also: Section 5!)

>>> RESEARCHER:				
The researcher name associated with the analysis.
It may be changed, but when you select your name from the researcher dropdown list, the results are automatically
associated with this name. This can save your energy of manually entering your name - and it also prevents misspelling errors.
So typically, you should not need to change it; rather enter and choose your name in the settings before doing an analysis.

>>> DATE:						
The date this result was created. 
It always has the form XX/YY/ZZZZ (with XX -> day, YY -> month and ZZ -> year), e.g. 24/03/17.
Please DO NOT CHANGE this entry.

>>> AVERAGE QUALITY (PERCENT):	
The average nucleotide quality in percent from 0 to 100 (calculated from the average PHRED score).
A value between 100 and 70 can be considered as 'very good quality',
a value between 69 and 40 is 'okay', while values below 40 are 'bad'.
Please DO NOT CHANGE this entry.

>>> PERCENTAGE OF QUALITY TRIM:
The percentage of nucleotides which got cut off from the sequence due to the quality trim.
Please DO NOT CHANGE this entry.

>>> NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE:		
The nucleotide sequence which was compared against the gene.
Please DO NOT CHANGE this entry.

>>> PRIMER:						
The primer associated with the sequence (entered by user). If desired you can type in the name of the primer used for this sequence. But it is not required.
If no primer was used or you don't want to specify one, just leave the 'none' in there.

>>> MUTATIONS (WITHOUT CODONS):	
The list of found mutations WITHOUT the codons.
Please DO NOT CHANGE this entry.

There are two important things to be mentioned regarding the CSV result files:
1. In case you edit a result file before uploading it, please DO NOT USE a semicolon (;) anywhere. It's the program's internal separator char. Using it can have undesired effects.
2. When you're working with the result files, Excel might ask you whether you want to convert the file from CSV format to Excel format. This is okay, but if you want to UPLOAD the results later on, you SHOULD NOT do this conversion. The program can only deal with the CSV format.
