# Make the gradle wrapper executable. This essentially downloads a copy of

# It is expected that any modern gradle project has a wrapper

    - cd p_GSAT/

# We redirect the gradle user home using -g so that it caches the

# Unfortunately it also caches the build output so
# cleaning removes reminants of any cached builds.
# The assemble task actually builds the project.
# If it fails here, the tests can't run.
